**Goal.** Compare two variants (A vs B) to estimate a causal lift on a metric (e.g., conversion rate).

### Core steps
1. Define primary metric and guardrail metrics.
2. Randomize assignment; ensure sample ratio is close to expected split.
3. Predefine duration and minimum detectable effect (MDE).
4. Analyze with difference-in-means or proportion tests; report effect sizes and CIs.
5. Check pitfalls: novelty effects, seasonality, peeking, sample-ratio mismatch.

### Common tests
- **Proportions**: z-test or chi-square for conversion rates.
- **Means**: t-test or nonparametric alternative.
- **Non-inferiority**: one-sided tests for rollbacks.
